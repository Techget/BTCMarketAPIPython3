# BTCMarketAPIPython3

Refer to official btcmarket api-python repo https://github.com/BTCMarkets/api-client-python, the original code only works with python2. I update it work with python3, refactor some of the functions to make that easier to use, and make the output more readable. 
Feel free to use it. And welcome any chats relate to automation trading and low-level blockchain technology.
