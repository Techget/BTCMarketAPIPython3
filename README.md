# BTCMarketAPIPython3

Refer to official btcmarket api-python repo [api-client-python
](https://github.com/BTCMarkets/api-client-python), the official code only works with python2. I've updated it to work with python3, refactor some of the functions to make that easier to use, also make the output more readable. 
Feel free to use it. And welcome any chats relate to automation trade and blockchain technology.
